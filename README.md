Formulation of Small   Molecules
1)                  Answer BOTH   parts of this questionOnychomycosis   is   the   most   common   nail   disorder.       Dr    Murdan    at   the    UCL   School of Pharmacy has synthesised a new anti-onychomycotic drug molecule.   Professor Basit has mixed the drug with excipients   and   prepared   a   formulation   that will be directly printed onto   patients’   onychomycotic   nails.
a)                      Discuss   how   the   properties   of   the   drug   molecule   might   influence   its   ungual   permeability.                                  (50%   of marks)
b)                      Discuss   how the   properties of the formulation   might influence its efficacy.   (50% of   marks)
2)                You   have   been asked to   develop   an   immediate   relase   tablet   formulation
containing 250mg of drug X. The drug is freely soluble across   the   entire   pH   range of the gastrointestinal tract.    Propose, with appropriate   justification, a suitable tablet formulation for drug X.                                                   代 写PHAY0033 Formulation of Small MoleculesStatistics

3)                   Explain TWO (2) formulation factors affecting oral transmucosal bioavailability.   Give   ONE   (1)   example of a formulation   approach to   improve oral   trasmucosal   absorption.       (100% of   marks)
4)                  Answer both parts   of this   question:a)                   Describe   the   two   main   formulation   principles   for   dry   powder   inhalation   (DPI),   including   in   your   answer   the   roles   of   forces   of   adhesion   and   cohesion   (50% of   marks)b)                   A    company    formulating      a      DPI    formulation      buys      milled      drug    from      a   supplier. The supplier changes its mill to a newtype; it   assures that the   particle   size   distribution   of   the    milled   drug    remains   the   same   as    before,    but   when   formulated   the   performance   of   the   DPI   product   is   reduced.   Explain   why   this   might be the case and what you   might do to   improve   the   situation.
